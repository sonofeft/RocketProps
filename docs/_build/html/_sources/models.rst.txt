Models
=======

The models chosen for the propellant properties database are described below.

In general, if a standard `REFPROP <https://www.nist.gov/srd/refprop>`_ fluid is available,
then `REFPROP <https://www.nist.gov/srd/refprop>`_ will be used as the source of the model data.
Standard `REFPROP <https://www.nist.gov/srd/refprop>`_ models are present for ethane, ethanol,
fluorine, oxygen, methane, methanol, nitrous oxide, ammonia, parahydrogen and propane.

For other propellants like A50, ClF5, IRFNA, MHF3, MMH, MON10 thru 30, N2H4, N2O4, RP1 and UDMH
other sources will be used. Data sources usually do not include the full temperature range
from freezing point to critical point, so some extrapolation or interpolation of the data is required.
`Properties of Gases and Liquids, Fifth Edition <https://www.accessengineeringlibrary.com/content/book/9780070116825>`_,
will be used to select appropriate models to represent and extend the data.

Vapor Pressure
--------------

Vapor pressure data will be extended using the **Wagner** equation.

For a number of published `REFPROP <https://www.nist.gov/srd/refprop>`_ fluids, the constants
for the **Wagner** equation are published. It can be seen from the vapor pressure charts for those 
propellants that `REFPROP <https://www.nist.gov/srd/refprop>`_ and the **Wagner** equation agree very well
(see: methane, methanol, ethane, ethanol, propane, ammonia and parahydrogen)

:ref:`Gas&Liq 5th Ed Source`
recommends that the **Wagner** equation may be used down to a reduced temperature of 0.5, however,
all of the REFPROP examples show its continued accuracy below that temperature.

The equation requires four constants to be fitted to fluid vapor pressure data.

Edalat

The `Edalat Vapor Pressure equation <https://thermo.readthedocs.io/thermo.vapor_pressure.html#thermo.vapor_pressure.Edalat>`_
can estimate vapor pressure over a range of temperatures. It is taken from the 
`thermo <https://pypi.org/project/thermo/>`_  project which is an open-source 
project on `pypi.org <https://pypi.org/>`_ developed by Caleb Bell 
and Contributors (2016-2020). 

It can be used to scale a sparse set of vapor pressure data (e.g. normal boiling point) or
when no vapor pressure data is available, it can estimate the full range of vapor pressure.

Density
-------

Density data will be extended using either the **Rackett** Equation, 
the **Yamada and Gunn** modification of the **Rackett** Equation or the **Daubert** Equation.

:ref:`Gas&Liq 5th Ed Source`
defines those equations as follows.

Daubert
```````

The **Daubert** Equation changed the physical quantities and constants of Eq.
(4-11.1) into four adjustable parameters to give the equation below.
The value of C is generally equal to Tc while
A, B, and D are generally close to the values used in Eq. (4-11.3) above.
For propellants like MON10, MON25 and MON30, the Daubert equation does a good
job of fitting data without needing the temperature-dependent  pseudocritical properties of 
the mixtures.

The constants A, B, C and D were curve fit for MON10, MON25 and MON30.::

Heat Capacity
-------------

Liquid heat capacity approximations often start by calculating a residual heat capacity.

The residual heat capacity is the difference between the liquid and ideal gas
heat capacities. The following excerpt from :ref:`Gas&Liq 5th Ed Source`
describes one such method.

.. image:: ./_static/cp_corr_states.jpg

The above residual heat capacity can be added to the ideal gas heat capacity
as calculated by the Joback method below.

.. _Joback Source:

Joback
``````
The `Joback method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joback_method>`_ 
(often named Joback/Reid method) predicts eleven important and 
commonly used pure component thermodynamic properties from molecular structure only. 

The approach for ideal gas is shown below.

Viscosity
---------

.. _Squires Source:

Squires
```````

Figure 9-13 from :ref:`Gas&Liq 5th Ed Source` displays the Lewis and Squires liquid
viscosity vs temperature correlation. It leads to the scaling equation 9-10.3.

Given a reference viscosity at a given temperature, the value at a different
temperature may be calculated.

project on `pypi.org <https://pypi.org/>`_ developed by Caleb Bell

It estimates the thermal conductivity of a liquid as a function of temperature using a 
CSP method. It is a statistically derived equation using the following correlated terms.

Surface Tension
---------------

.. _Sastri-Rao Source:

Sastri-Rao
``````````

Surface tension can be scaled using equation 12-4.1 from :ref:`Gas&Liq 5th Ed Source`.
The value of n varies from 0.8 for alcohols in the Sastri-Rao method to 1.22, or 11/ 9 for
other compounds.

.. image:: ./_static/surften_scaling_rao.jpg

For propellants having some surface tension data, n was derived from curve fit.
Those values are::

              n
    N2H4 = 1.322137
    N2O4 = 0.960017
    A50  = 1.000717
    MHF3 = 0.859508
    MMH  = 0.846186
    UDMH = 1.018771

project on `pypi.org <https://pypi.org/>`_ developed by Caleb Bell

For propellants with no surface tension data available, the
`Pitzer surface tension equation <https://thermo.readthedocs.io/thermo.interface.html#thermo.interface.Pitzer>`_
can be used to predict surface tension.

Pseudocritical Properties
-------------------------

For propellants that are mixtures of other propellants (like A50, MHF3, MON10, MON25 or MON30)
the critical properties are not pure fluid properties, but a combination of the constituent properties.

.. _Tc Mixture:

Tc Mixture
``````````

For pseudocritical temperature, 
:ref:`Gas&Liq 5th Ed Source`
recommends the simplest mixing rule; a mole fraction average method. 
This rule is often called one of Kay's rules.

Comparison of Tcm from Eq. (5-3.1) with values determined from other, 
more complicated rules shows that the differences in Tcm are usually less
than 2% if, for all components the pure component critical properties are not extremely different.


.. image:: ./_static/kays_rule_eqn.jpg


.. _Pc Mixture:

Pc Mixture
``````````

From :ref:`Gas&Liq 5th Ed Source`
for  the pseudocritical pressure, Pcm, a mole-fraction average of pure-component
critical pressures is normally unsatisfactory. This is because the critical pressure for
most systems goes through a maximum or minimum with composition. The only
exceptions are if all components of the mixture have quite similar critical pressures
and/ or critical volumes. The simplest rule which can give acceptable Pcm values
for two-parameter or three-parameter CSP is the modified rule of Prausnitz and
Gunn (1958)

.. image:: ./_static/prausnitz_and_gunn_eqn.jpg

where **all of the mixture pseudocriticals Zcm , Tcm , and Vcm are given by mole-fraction
averages** (Kay's rule) and R is the universal gas constant of **Table 4-1**.

According to
:ref:`Gas&Liq 5th Ed Source`,
the mixture pseudo acentric factor is commonly given
by a mole fraction average (Joffe, 1971)
